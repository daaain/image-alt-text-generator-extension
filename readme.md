# Image alt text generator

This is an experimental browser extension to generate descriptive alt text for images that don't
have one, on any web page.

To make this possible, it does:

* Recursively traverse the DOM to find images and check their alt property
* Collect images that have missing or bad (<20 characters currently) alt text
* Convert these images to Base64 JPEGs
* Send them to a multi-modal (text + vision) model and ask it to describe the image
* Inject the detailed (usually 2 paragraphs) description back into the image alt property

## ðŸŒ‹ LlaVa model

For this extension to work, you need to have LlaVa 1.5 running in the Llama.cpp web server.

To set these up you can follow these steps on an Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Mac:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.git
cd llama.cpp
make
wget https://huggingface.co/mys/ggml_llava-v1.5-7b/resolve/main/ggml-model-q5_k.gguf
wget https://huggingface.co/mys/ggml_llava-v1.5-7b/resolve/main/mmproj-model-f16.gguf
./server -m ggml-model-q5_k.gguf --mmproj mmproj-model-f16.gguf -ngl 1
```

## ðŸ›  Development

1. Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies
1. Run `npm run all` to build with Parcel and watch for changes; run the Web-ext library to pack the
development extension and open it in Chromium; and to serve up the contents of `test_page`
